# Customer Churn Prediction

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict customer churn, a critical concern for businesses. It includes data visualization, preprocessing, and the implementation of various classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

## Key Features

- Data visualization for churn analysis
- Handling imbalanced data using SMOTEENN
- Model selection and cross-validation
- Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search
- Ensemble methods and evaluation metrics

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to enhance this project by adding more classification models, improving data preprocessing, or enhancing visualization, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.
